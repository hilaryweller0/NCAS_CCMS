\section{Practical: Solving a Differential Equation using Finite Differences}

This practical is open ended and we will build on it during the week.
Everyone has different knowledge and experience coding numerical methods
so during this practical you will choose your own equation to solve
and choose or design a numerical method to solve it. If you have not
coded numerical methods before, you might like to start with the one
dimensional linear advection equation and make modifications to the
code in section \ref{sec:CTCScode} or inertial oscillations and start
from the code in section \ref{sec:intertial_FB}. For the more adventurous,
you could choose an equation that you are interested in or pick a
couple of terms from one of the Navier-Stokes equations to model.
Please discuss your decisions with the staff. Also feel free to find
equations and numerical methods online. Some equations that you might
like to consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item The non-linear advection equation (Burger's equation)
\item The linear or non-linear shallow-water equations
\item The diffusion equation (easier than the linear advection equation)
\item Inertial oscillations. You could start from the code in section \ref{sec:intertial_FB},
see what happens when you make the time-step very large and then try
to make the time-stepping implicit.
\end{itemize}
You will probably learn most if you stick with one dimensional equations. 

You will have an opportunity at the end of the week to tell the rest
of the class what equation you have chosen, how you have chosen to
solve it and if you have any results or problems so far.
